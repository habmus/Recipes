    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pad Thai is a classic Thai street food that's known for its balance of sweet, sour, salty, and umami flavors. The
        dish consists of stir-fried rice noodles mingled with eggs, tofu, and shrimp or chicken, tossed in a
        savory-sweet tamarind-based sauce. It's typically garnished with crushed peanuts, fresh lime wedges, and
        cilantro, providing a crunch and zest that elevate the dish. Bean sprouts add a crisp texture, while the use of
        fish sauce, sugar, and chili pepper contribute to its distinctive taste. Pad Thai stands as a culinary icon of
        Thailand, offering a taste experience that's both complex and harmonious.
