    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Amala is a traditional Nigerian food, often found in the western part of the country, made from yam flour,
        plantain flour, or cassava flour. This smooth,
        stretchy dough is a staple in the Yoruba cuisine and is known for its soft, elastic texture and the ability to
        absorb savory soups and stews. Amala is usually served with a variety of soups,
        such as ewedu (jute), ogbono, or egusi, making it an integral part of Nigerian communal meals. Its deep
        grayish-brown color, particularly when made from yam flour, distinguishes it from other African fufu dishes.
        Amala is not only cherished for its taste but also valued for its nutritional benefits,
        including its high fiber content.</p>
